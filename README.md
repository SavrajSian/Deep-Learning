# Deep-Learning

The first coursework involved implementing a number of Pytorch convolution related function for part 1. Part 2 required me to create a CNN to classify images from the NaturalImageNet dataset. 

The second coursework was based on generative models. Part 1 uses a VAE on the MNIST dataset; a balance between reconstructive and generative performance was needed. Part 2 involved the use of a convolutional GAN architcture to generate images based on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Part 2 of both courseworks required extensive experimentation with architectural changes, data augmentation, different loss functions and more. Explainations of things tried and evaluations are contained in both files.
